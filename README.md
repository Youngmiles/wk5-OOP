SUPERHERO CLASS SYSTEM

This Python program demonstrates object-oriented programming principles with a focus on inheritance and polymorphism through a superhero class hierarchy. 
The system models different types of superheroes with their unique abilities and characteristics.

Features
1. Base Superhero class with core attributes:

Name, secret identity, powers and base of operations

Health tracking and equipment management

2. Polymorphic Abilities System
Shared methods with hero-specific implementations:

use_power() - Each hero type uses powers differently

transform() - Titan shifters have unique transformation logic

__str__() - Custom string representations for each type

VEHICLE SIMULATOR 🚗 🚌 🚑 🚒 🚋 🚝 🏍 ✈

This Python program demonstrates object-oriented programming principles with a focus on polymorphism through different vehicle types. 
Each vehicle class implements common methods in unique ways while sharing a consistent interface.

Features
1. Base Vehicle class with core functionality

5 distinct vehicle types with unique movement behaviors:

🚗 Car: Road driving with honking

✈️ Airplane: Flight with takeoff capability

⛵ Boat: Water sailing with anchoring

🚂 Train: Rail movement with whistle

🚴 Bicycle: Pedaling with bell ringing

Shared methods with vehicle-specific implementations:

move() - Each vehicle moves differently

travel_time() - Consistently calculates trip duration
